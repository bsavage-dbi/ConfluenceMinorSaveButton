ConfluenceMinorSaveButton
=========================

Chrome extension that adds a 'Minor Save' button when editing a confluence page

Making a minor save was more work than doing a normal save, what confluence needed was a new save button - the minor save button.

Clicking the button merely checks the minor save checkbox and then clicks the save button.

Simple.
